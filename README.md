5. 3 different levels of questions : Easy (5 out of 10 questions), Medium (3 out of 6 questions), Hard (2 out of 4 questions)

                                              50-50 (2 wrong options are removed)
                                              Expert Advice (pretty much guaranteed correct answer, 1/100 chance to be wrong)
                                              Audience Poll (almost a sure-shot correct answer, 1/1000 chance to be wrong)
