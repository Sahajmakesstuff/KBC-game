# KBC-game
An attempt to digitally recreate a quiz game with various features

What Features do I want?
1. It Should be a functioning quiz where the program asks the user the question
2. If answer is correct, then it moves onto next question
3. If answer is wrong, then it stops
4. A point system where each question gives 1 point
5. 3 different levels of questions : Easy (5 out of 10 questions), Medium (3 out of 6 questions), Hard (2 out of 4 questions)
6. Lifelines to help the player: 4 lifelines: Phone a Friend (1 correct answer and 1 incorrect answer)
                                              50-50 (2 wrong options are removed)
                                              Expert Advice (pretty much guaranteed correct answer, 1/100 chance to be wrong)
                                              Audience Poll (almost a sure-shot correct answer, 1/1000 chance to be wrong)
                                              

What is added till now?
1. Just a basic framework. It chooses 5 questions out of the 10 (currently placeholder) questions and displays the corresponding options
2. Removing the questions already picked so that there are no repeats
